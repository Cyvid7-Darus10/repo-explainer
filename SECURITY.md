# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately through [GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/Cyvid7-Darus10/repo-explainer/security/advisories/new). Do not open a public issue. You should get a reply within 5 working days.

## Scope

These are in scope:

- Script injection through explainer data (the page must render all data as text)
- The scanner reading or emitting secret values
- Path traversal or command injection in the CLI

## Design notes

- Rendering uses `textContent` / `setAttribute` only. A test bans `innerHTML`, `eval` and `new Function`.
- Embedded JSON escapes `<`, `>`, `&`, U+2028 and U+2029.
- The scanner skips symlinks and only reads env var *names* from `.env.example`-style files.
- Git is invoked with `execFileSync` and an argument array, never through a shell.
